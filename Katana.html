<br>A Katanta is a sacred object used by samurai as protection as well as a status symbols. Created in the Heian period the katatna was the weapon of choice among the samuri and military nobility.The katana can be swung in an assortment of ways which includes verticaly or horizontaly. In this case we will be practicing the basic swing of a katana, a vertical swing. first, postion your hands at the top and bottom of the handle, hold the katana in front of you so it's perpendicular to the ground.Next, stand in front of your target so you can reach it with the blade of the katana.After, hold the blade above your head so it's near parallel to the ground.Next, push the top of the handle forward to help the blade arc. After, step foward as you bring the blade down toward the target(note that you should'nt use heavy force when swinging the katana, instead let the katana do it's work and swing lightly to hit your target). Slice into the target at a slight 45- degree angle.There you have it, you have successfully swung a katana.</br>
